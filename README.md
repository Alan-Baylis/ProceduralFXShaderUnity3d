#Procedural FX Shader
Toolkit and demos for creating continuous procedural effects using simple shaders.

## Shader Runner
```ShaderRunner``` is the core component class for executing these shaders. It creates a double buffer and executes the desires shader a set number of iterations per frame.

## Procedural FX Shader for Unity3d
Experiment in creating GPU calculated reaction diffusion systems and other parralizable grid caluclations.

The core of this library is the simple ShaderRunner class which uses a double buffer to create stepped time grid calculations to generate interesting simulations and effects.
